## STOP HERE AND READ ME FIRST!
Before continuing, let us be the first to welcome you to the Source.  While it
might be confusing at first, there's a lot you can learn if you make the time.

Use this URI:
> https://www.roleplaygateway.com/

From there, links like `hub.roleplaygateway.com` might "pop up" from time to
time.  With a bit of navigating around, you can earn credit for your progress.

Continue:
> https://chat.roleplaygateway.com/

Offline:
> https://www.roleplaygateway.com/medals/beta-tester

Remember: never be afraid to explore!  Curiosity might have killed the cat, but
that's why he had nine lives.

Good luck, have fun (`gl;hf o/`), and enjoy!
